# Heart-Rate-Monitor
This project creates a heart rate monitoring app by attaching a pulse sensor to an Arduino Uno for data collection. The data is processed in MATLAB to display a real-time heart rate graph. It includes a button to diagnose normal, bradycardic, or tachycardic heart rates.

 Make sure you have all the necessary libraries installed on your Arduino IDE. Ensure you've downloaded everything needed to establish the Arduino-MATLAB connection. Attach the pulse sensor to your Arduino Uno. Open the Arduino IDE, load the provided code for the pulse sensor, and upload it to your Arduino Uno board.
 In MATLAB, open the file named 'rulare'. Press the 'Run' button in MATLAB. This will launch the application developed for heart rate monitoring.
 Press on the pulse sensor to start monitoring. The application will display the heart rate (BPM) fluctuations on the graph in real-time.
 Please ensure your Arduino is connected to your computer and the correct port is selected in MATLAB before running the 'rulare' file.
